# Derivative_Calculator

This is a visually basic derivative calculator utilizing recursion and binary tree structures to achieve the result. This project is made in Java.

It first parses the string input into a binary tree following BEDMAS rules, then simplifies it.
It then computes the derivative of it and simplifies it again.
The tree is then converted back into a string for the user to read.
